 Walnut trees are any species of tree in the plant genus Juglans, the
  type genus of the family Juglandaceae, the seeds of which are referred to as
  walnuts. All species are deciduous trees, 10–40 metres (33–131 ft) tall, with
  pinnate leaves 200–900 millimetres (7.9–35.4 in), with 5–25 leaflets; the
  shoots have chambered pith, a character shared with the wingnuts (Pterocarya),
  but not the hickories (Carya) in the same family. (wikipedia)
