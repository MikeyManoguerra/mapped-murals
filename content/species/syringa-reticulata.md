Summary



Syringa reticulata, the Japanese tree lilac. is a species of flowering plant in the family Oleaceae native to eastern Asia, which is grown as an ornamental in Europe and North America.

Description
It is a deciduous small tree growing to a height of 39' (12 m), rarely to 49' (15 m), with a trunk up to 11.8" (30 cm), rarely 15.7" (40 cm) diameter; it is the largest species of lilac, and the only one that regularly makes a small tree rather than a shrub. The leaves are elliptic-acute, 1"-6"(2.5–15 cm) long and 1/2"-4" (1–8 cm) broad, with an entire margin, and a roughish texture with slightly impressed veins. The flowers are white or creamy-white, the corolla with a tubular base 0.16"-0.24"(4–6 mm) long and a four-lobed apex 0.12"-0.24" (3–6 mm) across, and a strong fragrance; they are produced in broad panicles 2"-11" (5–30 cm) long  and 1"-8" (3–20 cm) broad in early summer. The fruit is a dry, smooth brown capsule (15–25 mm long), splitting in two to release the two winged seeds.
Distribution
Syringa reticulata is found in northern Japan (mainly Hokkaidō), northern China (Gansu, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, Nei Mongol, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan), Korea, and far southeastern Russia (Primorye).
