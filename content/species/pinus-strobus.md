 Pinus strobus, commonly denominated the eastern white pine, northern
  white pine, white pine, Weymouth pine (British), and soft pine[2] is a large
  pine native to eastern North America. It occurs from Newfoundland, Canada west
  through the Great Lakes region to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota, United
  States, and south along the Appalachian Mountains and upper Piedmont to
  northernmost Georgia and perhaps very rarely in some of the higher elevations
  in northeastern Alabama.[3] It is considered rare in Indiana.[4] /(wikipedia)/
